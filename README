NAME
    CPAN::Recent::Uploads - Find the distributions recently uploaded to CPAN

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Recent::Uploads;

      my $weekago = time() - ( 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 );

      my @uploads = CPAN::Recent::Uploads->recent( $weekago );

      # as a one liner (seeing the weeks worth of uploads).

      perl -MCPAN::Recent::Uploads -le 'print for CPAN::Recent::Uploads->recent;'

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Recent::Uploads provides a mechanism for obtaining a list of the
    RECENT uploads to "CPAN" as determined from the files produced by
    File::Rsync::Mirror::Recentfile that exist in the "authors/" directory
    on "CPAN".

FUNCTIONS
    "recent"
        Takes two optional arguments. The first argument is an "epoch" time
        you wish to find the uploads since. If it is not supplied the
        default is the current time minus one week. The second argument is
        the URL of a "CPAN" mirror you wish to query. If it is not supplied
        then "ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/CPAN/" is used.

        In a list context it returns a list of uploaded distributions
        ordered by the time they were uploaded (ie. oldest first, increasing
        in recentness ).

        In a scalar context it returns a hash reference keyed on
        distribution with the values being the "epoch" time that that
        distribution entered "CPAN".
