    Bump version for CPAN release

  commit 2f9692624502272e8aa77484a282b563f83d483e
  Author: Jeroen Latour <tour@jeroen.la>

    Resolve [RT #69119] "Module can be used only once per session"

    Because the current implementation of 'recent' modifies @times, it is
    not possible to call it multiple times in one session (well, it works
    a few times, but it will start to download increasingly bigger files
    until @times is finally empty).

    The attached patch resolves this.
